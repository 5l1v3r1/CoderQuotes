             "[ Most good programmers do programming not because they expect to get paid or get adulation by the public, but because it is fun to program. -Linus Torvalds ]",
             "[ The idea that I can be presented with a problem, set out to logically solve it with the tools at hand, and wind up with a program that could not be legally used because someone else followed the same logical steps some years ago and filed for a patent on it is horrifying. -John Carmack ]",
             "[ Everyone knows that debugging is twice as hard as writing a program in the first place. So if you're as clever as you can be when you write it, how will you ever debug it? -Brian Kernighan ]",

             "[ Every good Programmers are start from Noobgrammers. -Naufal Yudhistira ]",

             "[ Walking on water and developing software from a specification are easy if both are frozen. -Edward V Berard ]",
             "[ Programming isn't about what you know; it's about what you can figure out. -Chris Pine ]",
             "[ The question of whether a computer can think is no more interesting than the question of whether a submarine can swim. -Edsger Dijkstra ]",
             "[ Debugging is like being the detective in a crime movie where you are also the murderer. -Filipe Fortes] ",
             "[ when you don't create things, you become defined by your tastes rather than ability. ... ]",
